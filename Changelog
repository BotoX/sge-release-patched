DT-2003-11-28-0: Enhancem.: Made sge_gethostbyname() reentrant in four of the
                            five possible ways depending on the architecture.
                            I'll let AD do the fifth way: mutex locking.
                            I changed sge_getme() to use sge_gethostbyname()
                            and sge_gethostbyaddr().
                            I removed the misplaced daemons/shadowd/gethostbyname.*
                            files and replaced them with a sge_gethostbyname_retry()
                            function in sge_hostname.c.
                            I fixed a minor DRMAA bug when passing in a NULL
                            rusage pointer, and narrowed the scope of the event
                            client using SG's new interface.
                            I also fixed the build on HPUX-11.
                            I still need AD to add mutex locking to
                            sge_gethostbyname() default case and sge_gethostbyaddr().
                            I also need to apply platform specific gethostbyaddr_r()
                            synamtecs to sge_gethostbyaddr().
                 Changed:   sge_hostname.*, sge_prog.c, gethostbyname.*, aimk,
                            shadowd.c, DRMAA, and lots of Makefiles.

                            could easily be added to qsub et al.  Also added

                 Enhancem.: Phase 2 of dealing with complexes in the scheduler. 
                            In this version the scheduler only generetes attributes 
                            in the complex lists needed by the job. This is done by 
                            two filtering steps. The first filter contains the names 
                            of the complexes requested by the job, the second 
                            contains all names avaiable at the current test level( 
                            global, host, queue). The test is done with the 
                            complexes, which satisfy of first filter and second filter.

                 Enhancem.: The SGEEE scheduler needs quite some time to generate 
                            and submit the pending job tickets. Therefor a new 
                            "schedd_params" parameter ("REPORT_PJOB_TICKETS") as a 
                            boolean switch is introduced. When REPORT_PJOB_TICKETS=0 
                            is set, the scheduler resets all pending job tickets 
                            to 0 on the qmaster side and does not report any more 
                            pending tickets. The default is REPORT_PJOB_TICKETS=1.?

AH-2003-08-26-0: Enhancem.: Made libsec thread safe by using OpenSSL threads(3) 
                            interface.

                            Link shared against 0.9.7b OpenSSL libraries.
                            Added aimk -secure-static switch to be used for OS architectures 
                            where shared linking OpenSSL libraries are not available.
                            Changed sge_ca and sge_ssl.cnf to support more recent 
                            OpenSSL naming convention (AA).

SG-2003-08-19-1: Bugfix:   - "Qstat -F complex_name" did not filter for the 
                             complex_name and displayed all complexes
                           - working on large job lists was very slow due to 
                             the hashing. This change was introduced in 
                             JG-2002-12-17-0 as an enhancement. The JG code 
                             is commented out and can be added again, when 
                             the hashing really improves the speed.
                           - Fixed bug: 586. All slots in a queue are used 
                             for job dispatching.

                             used.
                           - changed the way "xxx2scheduler" functions generate 
                             their result list. They build a filter now to 
                             generate a list, which only contains the needed 
                             elements, instead of removing the unused ones in 
                             the end.
                           - devided the complex list for deciding if a job is 
                             suitable for a queue into two: a host complex list 
                             and a queue complex list.

AH-2003-06-02-0: Enhacem.:  Use session filtering with all non-total-update 
                            events. Since sgeE_JOB_USAGE and 
                            sgeE_JOB_FINAL_USAGE are non-total-update events 
                            session event filtering is applied to these events.
                            Don't use job error state for DRMAA jobs 
                            (JOB_TYPE_NO_ERROR).
                            Started implementing drmaa_wif*() functions.
                            Made DRMAA work also with GEEE. To facilitate this 
                            now only sgeE_JOB_FINISH events (JR_Type) are used 
                            to track job exists events in JAPI.
                            Code deriving SGE job templates from a DRMAA job 
                            template is now kept in drmaa.c
                            Added automated session key generation to JAPI.
                            Added session restart capability to JAPI.
                            Interface JAPI session restart capability in DRMAA 
                            by means of SGE_SESSION_KEY and SGE_KEEP_SESSION 
                            env var.
                            Use env var SGE_DELAY_AFTER_SUBMIT to interface 
                            with hook for delayed submission.
                            Added new test cases to ensure jobs finish with 
                            DRMAA_PS_FAILED state and drmaa_wifaborted()==true 
                            if wrong input/output/error file was specified.
