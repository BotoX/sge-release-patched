How to use the review form

1 please fill in the required information

1.1 IssueZilla ID

1.2 Bugtraq ID, if available

1.3 one line summary/issue title

1.4 ID from the Changelog file (e.g. JG-2002-07-31-0). 

1.5 Use the sunsource user name(s)

1.6 Use the sunsource user name(s)


2 Check all features and properties defined in the specification.


3 Check if the documentation has been changed or change requests have been made

3.1 Does the issue make necessary any changes in the user or admin guide? 
    If yes, have the changes been documented and communicated to the doc writer?

3.2 Are any man page updates necessary? 
    If yes, have they been done?
    Are they understandable from a user perspective?

3.3 If commandline switches are implemented, check the -help output (has to 
    exist and be understandable from a users view)

3.4 All interfaces have to be documented.
    The following interfaces have to be documented - any documentation beyond 
    the obligated is welcome:
    - GDI Interface
    - Event client interface
    - any library functions
    If interfaces changed, analyze all affected situations/code pieces.
    Documentation shall be done using ADOC headers.

3.5 If messages changed, check if they are correct and meaningful.
    Output formats shall only be changed if unavoidable - such changes have to 
    be documented.

4 Check source code (diff)

4.1 Does the source code conform to our coding styleguide?

4.2 If memory is allocated, check for deallocation, access to freed memory, 
    boundaries, static buffer sizes ...

4.3 Is the code thread safe? Are all system calls / sge functions the code calls
    thread safe? Does the autodoc header of the function contain info about 
    thread safety?

5 Check if adequate testing has taken place

5.1 Which manual tests have been done? 
    Include a short description.

5.2 Does the testsuite sufficiently cover the issue?
    If not, please consider adding a new test yourself.

5.3 If the testsuite does not cover the issue, a testsuite issue has to be 
    created.
    This issue should contain information about test cases (usually will 
    reflect the manual tests), 
    if scripts have been written for the manual testing, they should be 
    attached to the issue.

5.4 A testsuite run should always be done before checking in code. 
    Even if there is no special test case for the issue, testsuite might show 
    problems or sideeffects.
