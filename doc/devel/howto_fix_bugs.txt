To gain a high level of quality and to ensure bugs will not turn up again in 
future releases, we'll use the following procedure when fixing bugs.

1. Create a testsuite test that will recognize the bug.
2. Fix the bug.
3. Verify bug fix with testsuite.
4. Review.
5. Merge the fix to other branches as necessary, repeat steps 3 (testsuite) 
   and 4 (review).

All testsuite development is done in maintrunk.
The maintrunk testsuite can test both 5.3 and 6.0 systems.
