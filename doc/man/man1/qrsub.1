.SH DESCRIPTION

.I Qrsub
Submits an AR to the xxQS_NAMExx queuing system.
.br
For qrsub the administrator and the user may define default request files 
(analogous to xxqs_name_sxx_request for qsub), which can contain any of 
the possible command line options. 
.br
A cluster wide default request file is optional.
If it is used must be placed under 
.br
$xxQS_NAME_Sxx_ROOT/$xxQS_NAME_Sxx_CELL/common/sge_ar_request (global defaults file).
.br
A user private default request file is optional. If it is used must be placed under 
.br
$HOME/.sge_ar_request (user private defaults file).
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.\"
.IP "\fB\-a date_time\fP"
Defines the activation (start) date_time of an AR.
\fBDate_time\fP is not mandatory and if omitted, the current date_time is assumed. Either a duration or end date_time must also be specified. For details about date_time please see
.M sge_types 1
.\"
.IP "\fB\-A account_string\fP"
Identifies the account to which the resource consumption of the job, assigned to be part of AR,
should be charged. For the "\fB\-A account_string\fP" value details please see "\fBname\fP" definition in 
.M sge_types 1 .
In the absence of this parameter xxQS_NAMExx 
will place the default account string "xxqs_name_sxx" in the accounting record
of the AR's job.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-ckpt ckpt_name\fP"
Selects the checkpointing environment (see
.M checkpoint 5 )
the AR's jobs may request. Using this option guarantees only queues that provides this ckpt environment are used for reserving.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-d time\fP"
Defines the duration of the AR.
The duration time is not mandatory.
if \fB"-d duration"\fP is requested, value must conform to either hh:mm:ss or seconds. For
the details please see
.M sge_types 1 .
.\"
.IP "\fB\-e date_time\fP"
Defines the end date and time of an AR.
The end time is not mandatory. If it is specified, either start date_time or duration must also be specified.
if \fB"-e date_time"\fP is requested, value must conform to [[CC]]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]. For details please see
.M sge_types 1 .
.\"
.IP "\fB\-he y[es]|n[o]\fP"
Specifies the behavior when the AR goes into an error state. 
A hard error "\fB\-he yes\fP" means as long as the AR is in error state no jobs using the AR will be scheduled. 
If soft error "\fB\-he no\fP" is specified the AR stays usable with the remaining resources.
.br
By default the soft error handling is used.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-help\fP"
Prints a listing of all options.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-l resource=value\fP,..."
Creates an AR in a xxQS_NAMExx queue, providing the given resource request list.
In case of
.M complex 5
describes how a list of available resources and their
associated valid value specifiers can be obtained.
.br
There may be multiple \fB\-l\fP switches in a single
command.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-m b|e|a|n\fP"
Defines or redefines under which circumstances mail is to be sent
to the AR's owner or to the users defined with the
\fB\-M\fP option described below. The option arguments
have the following meaning:
.sp 1
.nf
.ta \w'|b|  'u
`b'     Mail is sent at the beginning of the AR
`e'     Mail is sent at the end of the AR
`a'     Mail is sent when the AR goes into error state
`n'     No mail is sent
.fi
.\"
.IP "\fB\-M user[@host],...\fP"
Defines or redefines the list of users to which the qmaster
send mail.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-masterq wc_queue_list\fP"
Only meaningful for parallel job's AR, i.e. together with the -pe option.
.sp 1
It's used to reserve the proper queues to match this request if it would be requested by a qsub.
A more detailed description of \fIwc_queue_list\fP 
can be found in
.M sge_types 1 .
.\"
.IP "\fB\-now y[es]|n[o]\fP"                        
This options has impact, how the queues are reserved.
.br
With the \fB\-now y\fP option, cause to reserve the queues, that have the qtype "INTERACTIVE" assigned.
\fB\-now n\fP is default for \fIqrsub\fP.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-N name\fP"
The name of the AR. The name if it si used must conform "\fBname\fP" as it is defined in 
.M sge_types 1 .
Invalid job names will be denied
at a submit time.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-w e/v\fP"
\fB\-w v\fP validate availability of AR request
\fB\-w e\fP submit the AR request.
\fB\-w e\fP is default for \fIqrsub\fP.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-pe parallel_env \fBn\fP[\fB-\fP[\fBm\fP]]|[\fB-\fP]\fBm\fP,...\fP"
Parallel programming environment (PE) to select for the AR reservation of queues. 
Please see the details of PE the parallel_env in
.M sge_types 1 .
.\"
.IP "\fB\-q wc_queue_list\fP"
Defines or redefines a list of cluster queues, queue domains or queue
instances, that may be reserved by the AR. Please find a description
of \fIwc_queue_list\fP in
.M sge_types 1 .
This parameter has all the properties of a resource request and
will be merged with requirements derived from the \fB\-l\fP option
described above.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-u username,...\fP"
Job submission to this AR are allowed for the owner of AR or the users specified in the list
of usernames.

files.
.\"
.IP "\fBxxQS_NAME_Sxx_CELL\fP" 1.5i
If set, specifies the default xxQS_NAMExx cell. To address a xxQS_NAMExx
cell \fIqsub\fP, \fIqsh\fP, \fIqlogin\fP or \fIqalter\fP use (in the order of precedence):
.sp 1
.RS
.RS
The name of the cell specified in the environment 
variable xxQS_NAME_Sxx_CELL, if it is set.

.IP "\fBxxQS_NAME_Sxx_QMASTER_PORT\fP" 1.5i
If set, specifies the tcp port on which
.M xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster 8
is expected to listen for communication requests.
Most installations will use a services map entry for the
service "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.
