.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Qrdel
provides a means for a user/operator/manager to delete
one or more Advance Reservations (AR). A manager/operator can delete AR(s) belonging to any
user, while a regular user can only delete his or her own AR(s).
If a manager wants to delete another user's AR, the manager can specify
the AR id.A "qrdel wc_ar_name" will delete only the AR of belonging to  
that user by default. The manager is able to delete another user's AR via "-u wc_user_list". 
Jobs referring to an AR tagged for deletion will also be removed. 
Only if all jobs referring an AR are removed from the xxQS_NAMExx database 
the AR will also be removed.

.I Qrdel
deletes AR in the order in which their AR 
identifiers are presented. Find additional information concerning
\fIwc_user_list\fP and \fIwc_ar_list\fP in
.M sge_types 1 .
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.\"
.IP "\fB\-f\fP"
Force action for AR. The AR(s) are deleted from the list of an AR
registered at
.M xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster 8
even if the
.M xxqs_name_sxx_execd 8
controlling the AR(s) does not respond to the delete request sent by
.M xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster 8 .
.br
Users which are neither xxQS_NAMExx managers nor operators can only use the
.B \-f
option (for their own AR) if the cluster configuration entry
.\"
.IP "\fB\-help\fP"
Prints a listing of all options.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-u wc_user_list\fP"
Deletes only those AR(s) which were submitted by
users specified in the list of usernames.
For managers it is possible to use \fB\qrdel -u "*" "*"\fP to delete
all AR(s) of all users. If a manager wants to delete a specific
AR of a user, he has to specify the user and the AR id. If no 
AR is specified, all AR(s) belonging to that user are deleted.
.\"
.IP "\fBwc_ar_list\fP"
A list of AR id's, which should be deleted
