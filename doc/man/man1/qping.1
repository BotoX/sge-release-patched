.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Qping
is used to validate the runtime status of a xxQS_NAMExx service daemon. The current
xxQS_NAMExx implementation allows one to query the xxQS_NAME_Sxx_QMASTER daemon and any
running xxQS_NAME_Sxx_EXECD daemon. The qping command is used to send a SIM (Status
Information Message) to the destination daemon. The communication layer of the 
specified daemon will respond with a SIRM (Status Information Response Message) which
contains status information about the consulted daemon.
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.\"
.SS "\fB\-f\fP"
Show full status information on each ping interval.

\fIFirst output Line:\fP
The first output line shows the date and time of the request.

\fISIRM version:\fP
Internal version number of the SIRM (Status Information Response Message)

\fISIRM message id:\fP
Current message id for this connection

\fIstart time:\fP
Start time of daemon. The format is as follows:

MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS (seconds since 01.01.1970)

\fIrun time [s]:\fP
Run time in seconds since start time

\fImessages in read buffer:\fP
Nr. of buffered messages in communication buffer. The messages are buffered
for the application (daemon). When this number grows too large the daemon is not able
to handle all messages sent to it. 

\fImessages in write buffer:\fP
Nr. of buffered messages in the communication write buffer. The messages are sent
from the application (daemon) to the connected clients, but the communication 
layer wasn't able to send the messages yet. If this number grows too large, the
communication layer isn't able to send them as fast as the application (daemon) wants
the messages to be sent.

\fInr. of connected clients:\fP
This is the number of actual connected clients to this daemon. This also implies the
current qping connection.

\fIstatus:\fP
The status value of the daemon. This value depends on the application which reply to
the qping request.
If the application does not provide any information the status is 99999.
Here are the possible status information values for the xxQS_NAMExx daemons:

.in+3
qmaster:

.in+3
\fI0\fP
There is no unusual timing situation.
.in-3

.in+3
\fI1\fP
One or more threads has reached warning timeout. This may happen when 
at least one thread does not increment his time stamp for a not usual long
time. A possible reason for this is a high workload for this thread.
.in-3
    
.in+3
\fI2\fP
One or more threads has reached error timeout. This may happen when 
at least one thread has not incremented his time stamp for longer than
10 minutes.
.in-3

.in+3
\fI3\fP
The time measurement is not initialized.
.in-3

execd:

.in+3
\fI0\fP
There is no unusual timing situation.
.in-3

.in+3
\fI1\fP
Dispatcher has reached warning timeout. This may happen when 
the dispatcher does not increment his time stamp for a unusual long
time. A possible reason for this is a high workload.
.in-3
    
.in+3
\fI2\fP
Dispatcher has reached error timeout. This may happen when 
the dispatcher has not incremented his time stamp for longer than
10 minutes.
.in-3

.in+3
\fI3\fP
The time measurement is not initialized.
.in-3
.in-3


\fIinfo:\fP
Status message of the daemon. This value depends on the application which reply to
the qping request.
If the application does not provide any information the info message is "not available".
Here are the possible status information values for the xxQS_NAMExx daemons:

.in+3

qmaster:

.in+3
The info message contains information for each qmaster thread followed by a thread
state and time information:

.in+3
THREAD_NAME: THREAD_STATE (THREAD_TIME)
.in-3 

.in+3
THREAD_NAME:
.in+3
.nf
EDT:  Event Delivery Thread
TET:  Timed Event Thread
MT:   Message Thread
SIGT: SIGnal Thread
.fi
.in-3

THREAD_STATE:
.in+3
.nf
R: Running
W: Warning
E: Error
.fi
.in-3

THREAD_TIME:
.in+3
.nf
Time since last timestamp updating.
.fi
.in-3
.in-3

After the dispatcher information follows an additional information string which describes the
complete application status.
.in-3

execd:

.in+3
The info message contains information for the execd job dispatcher:
.in+3
dispatcher: STATE (TIME)
.in-3

STATE:
.in+3
.nf
R: Running
W: Warning
E: Error
.fi
.in-3

TIME:
.in+3
.nf
Time since last timestamp updating.
.fi
.in-3
.in-3

After the thread information follows an additional information string which describes the
application status.

.in-3
.in-3

.SS "\fB\-help\fP"
Prints a list of all options.

.SS "\fB\-i interval\fP"
Set qping interval time.

The default interval time is one second. Qping will send a SIM (Status Information Message)
on each interval time.

.SS "\fB\-info\fP"
Show full status information (see \fB\-f\fP for more information) and exit. The exit
value 0 indicates no error. On errors qping returns with 1.

.SS "\fB\-noalias\fP"
Ignore host_aliases file, which is located at 
\fI<xxqs_name_sxx_root>/<cell>/common/host_aliases.\fP
If this option is used it is not necessary to set any xxQS_NAMExx environment
variable. 

.SS "\fBhost\fP"
Host where daemon is running.

.SS "\fBport\fP"
Port which daemon has bound (used xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster/xxqs_name_sxx_execd port number).

.SS "\fBname\fP"
Name of communication endpoint ("qmaster" or "execd"). A communication endpoint is a 
triplet of hostname/endpoint name/endpoint id (e.g. hostA/qmaster/1 or subhost/qstat/4).

.SS "\fBid\fP"
Id of communication endpoint ("1" for daemons)
