.SH NAME
hostgroup \- host group entry file format
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A host group entry is used to merge host names to groups.
Each  host  group  entry  file defines one group. Inside a
group definition file you can also reference to groups. These
groups are called subgroups. A subgroup is referenced by the
sign "@" as first character of the name.
.PP
A list of currently configured host group entries can be displayed 
via the
.M qconf 1
\fB\-shgrpl\fP option. The contents of each enlisted host group entry 
can be
shown via the \fB\-shgrp\fP switch. The output follows the
.I hostgroup
format description. New host group entries can be created and existing can be
modified via the \fB\-ahgrp\fP, \fB\-mhgrp\fP, \fB\-dhgrp\fP and 
\fB\-?attr\fP options to
.M qconf 1 .

.SH EXAMPLE
This is a typical host group entry:

.PP
group_name @bigMachines
.PP
hostlist @solaris64 @solaris32 fangorn balrog
.PP

\fB@bigMachines\fP. In this host group are the host 
\fBfangorn\fP, \fBbalrog\fP and all members of the host groups 
\fB@solaris64\fP and \fB@solaris32\fP.
