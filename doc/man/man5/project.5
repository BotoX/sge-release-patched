.M qconf 1
\fB\-sprjl\fP option. The contents of each enlisted project definition
can be shown via the \fB\-sprj\fP switch. The output follows the
.I project
format description. New projects can be created and existing can be
modified via the \fB\-aprj\fP, \fB\-mprj\fP and \fB\-dprj\fP options to
.M qconf 1 .
