.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I SGE_Helper_Service.exe helps the 
.M xxqs_name_sxx_execd 8
to run Windows jobs that request to be allowed to display
their GUI on the visible Desktop. It is a Win32 service that is started at boot time
under the SYSTEM account, giving it the permissions to give any process the 
permissions to access the visible Desktop.
.br
This service runs independently of the
.M xxqs_name_sxx_execd 8
(i.e. it is not started and stopped together with the execution daemon) and there
can be only one SGE_Helper_Service.exe per host.
.br
Jobs can request to be allowed to display their GUI on the visible desktop by 
setting the job environment variable "SGE_GUI_MODE" to "TRUE" or "1". See
.M submit 1
, option "-v", for information on how to set a job environment variable.
