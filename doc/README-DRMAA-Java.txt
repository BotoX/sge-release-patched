1. Introduction
---------------

   DRMAA is a specification developed by a working group in the Global Grid
   Forum (GGF).  The best way to describe DRMAA is to cite the DRMAA-WG
   Charter:

      "Develop an API specification for the submission and control of jobs
      to one or more Distributed Resource Management (DRM) systems. The
      scope of this specification is all the high level functionality which
      is necessary for an application to consign a job to a DRM system
      including common operations on jobs like termination or suspension. 
      The objective is to facilitate the direct interfacing of applications
      to today's DRM systems by application's builders, portal builders, and
      Independent Software Vendors (ISVs)."

   Simply put, DRMAA is an API for submitting and controling jobs.  DRMAA
   has been implemented in several lanuages and for several DRMs.  The Grid
   Engine 6.0 release includes a C implementation, or C binding as well as a
   Java[TM] language binding.

   For more information about DRMAA and the various bindings that are
   available, visit the DRMAA website at:

      http://www.drmaa.org/

   There you will find links to the DRMAA specification and mailing list
   archives detailing the thought process that went into DRMAA.

   Information about grid computing standards in general can be found at the
   GGF website:

   release, see:

2. Getting Started
-------------------

   The Grid Engine 6.0 release supports a DRMAA Java language binding.  To
   develop applications that utilize the Java binding, you will need two files.
   The first is the jar file, drmaa.jar.  This file is need for both
   compiling and running applications utilizing the Java language binding.  The
   second file is the Java language binding shared library.  This file will need
   to be accessible from the LD_LIBRARY_PATH in order for your application to
   link properly and run.  If you built the binaries yourself (using "aimk
   -java"), you will find both of these files in the $SGE_ROOT/lib/$ARCH after
   using distinst -local to install the distribution.  Otherwise, you can
   download the binaries from the File Exchange at:

      http://gridengine.sunsource.net/servlets/ProjectDownloadList

   Look for the latest jdrmaa.tar file.  This file contains the drmaa.jar and
   the Java language binding shared libraries for all currently supported
   platforms.

   The first step is to look at the example program to be found at:

      http://gridengine.sunsource.net/source/browse/gridengine/source/classes/DRMAAExample.java

   The example program demonstrates a simple usage of the DRMAA library to
   submit several bulk jobs and several single jobs, wait for the jobs to
   finish, and then output the results.

   In the:
 
      http://gridengine.sunsource.net/source/browse/gridengine/source/classes/com/sun/grid/drmaa/howto/

   directory you will find the example programs from the online tutorial at:

      http://gridengine.sunsource.net/project/gridengine/howto/drmaa_java.html

   Once you're familiar with the DRMAA API, you're ready to begin
   development of your Java application.  When compiling your file, you will
   need to have $SGE_ROOT/lib/$ARCH/drmaa.jar included in your CLASSPATH.


3. Getting Support
------------------

   For commercial deployments N1GE6 DRMAA is recommended.

   to see if the problem your having is a know problem.  Alternately or for
   additional help you can send email to the dev@gridengine.sunsource.net
   mailing list.  You can also browse archives of this mailing list at:
